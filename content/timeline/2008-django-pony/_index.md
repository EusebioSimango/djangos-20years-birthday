In a keynote called "Why I Hate Django", a joke is made that Django needs a mascot with magical powers. Bryan Veloso comes up with [the first design](https://avalonstar.com/blog/2008/the-web-framework-for-ponies/), based on a design from iStockPhoto. A tagline "The web framework for ponies with magical powers" and [djangopony.com](https://djangopony.com/) is launched.

Dedicated to Malcolm Tredinnick (RIP 🕯️), Django 1.6 now officially supports Python 3 and it modernizes the `startproject` and `startapp` commands. Under the hood, persistent database connections are introduced to reuse the same db connection across multiple requests and a call to a Model's `save()` now requires just 1 database query instead of 2.

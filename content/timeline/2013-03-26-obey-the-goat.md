Harry Percival's book "Test Driven Web Development with Python" is out on O'Reilly - and is announced in [a blog post](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/tdd-web-programming-book-on-oreilly-early-release.html) on the "Obey the Testing Goat!" website. Harry's book, tutorials and website were influential to a lot of thinking around web development and the motivation for writing tests.

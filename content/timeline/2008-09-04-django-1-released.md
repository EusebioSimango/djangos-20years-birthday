Django version 1.0 is released and Django's Documentation (docs.djangoprojects.com) is officially launched.

> Since Django 0.96, we’ve made over 4,000 code commits, fixed more than 2,000 bugs, and edited, added, or removed around 350,000 lines of code. We’ve also added 40,000 lines of new documentation, and greatly improved what was already there.

Django version 0.96 is released: This would be the final "unstable" release before Django moved to the 1.0 series. Lots of new stuff gets added, including `loaddata` and `dumpdata` commands, introduction of `syncdb` (you might recall that from before Django had migrations), `django.newforms` library (which would replace `django.forms` in 1.0), and a new test client:

Kent Beck was the creator of "Extreme Programming" methods.

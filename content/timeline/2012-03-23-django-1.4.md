Exactly a year after 1.3 was released, 1.4 comes out: Django now supports timezones! `select_for_update` is added, a `--template` option for `manage.py startproject` and `manage.py startapp`, an explicit `wsgi.py` file, `prefetch_related` and `bulk_create` for the ORM, custom list filters for the admin, and much more.

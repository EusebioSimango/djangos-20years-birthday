Django will have migrations! This is perhaps the most well-known Django release, as South is replaced by a built-in migration framework. All Django projects will have to adapt, but the benefits are huge. South becomes the blueprint for the built-in migrations feature, which is lead once again by Andrew Godwin.

But that isn't the only big change: 1.7 also introduces the Application registry (an optional `apps.py` for applications), the system checks framework, as well as the widely popular `QuerySet.as_manager()` shortcut.

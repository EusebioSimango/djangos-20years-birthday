Jacob and Adrian resigns as so-called BDFLs, meaning that the full governance of Django's codebase is left to the DSF, and to the people with permissions to merge code. See also [Adrian's BDFL retirement](https://www.holovaty.com/writing/bdfls-retiring/) and [Jacob's BDFL retirement post](https://jacobian.org/2014/jan/13/retiring-as-bdfls/).

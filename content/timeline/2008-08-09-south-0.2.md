Django South 0.2 [is released](https://web.archive.org/web/20080831004106/http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/About). It notably becomes the migration framework for Django for many years (until Django 1.7 is released in 2014). If you were using Django between 2008 and 2014, you most likely also used South:

> Django has always made use of automatic schema generation - the almost-famous "syncdb" that must be run at least once (and often more) on every Django project. If you've ever used Django on a resonably large project, you quickly discover that you're deleting tables and regenerating them if you change schema - and that's only if you're in development, and can afford to possibly lose data.
>
> Other frameworks, such as the infamous Ruby on Rails, have migrations, which incrementally build up a schema as a series of migrations are executed, the idea being that a schema change is simply one more migration. South is an attempt to bring migrations over to Django, but in a more robust and useable way.
